# IS601 - Coffee Website - "Fresh Brew Coffee Co."

Website: [https://njit-wis.github.io/coffee_site/](https://njit-wis.github.io/coffee_site/)
<br><br>
For this course, the final group project consisted of agile web development [(project requirements)](https://github.com/kaw393939/webdev1_final_group)
<br><br>
In my group's Coffee Website, the design itself is very simple but also uses the same Github Pages template used for this website here. In the side nav, users can find a blog section, privacy policy, and incorporates Google Analytics and Mailchimp integrations to understand user metrics. 
<br>
I used the same coffee mug asset from my previous project, combining both project ideas (Fresh Brew Coffee Co. as a possible cafe to visit in the future?)

## Feature - [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/zs2EP6h9ywyqAfQfzFHB5P/Final-Project?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=jX160xV0E70pGjBu-1)

One of the project requirements was to make a mockup of the design of the website, to demonstrate what it ideally would look like.

This is essentially the backbone of the project. Each page is created as a Github Markdown page, and the website is hosted and deployed thru Github as well.

Our team was able to work on this project using agile methodolgy by using Github's integrated Projects function. We were able to assign each other User Stories to work on for this assignment, ranging from Technical Requirements, Design Requirements, and User Journey.
Having this integrated with other Github repository helped with linking specific pages where changes are made, or sharing screenshots of issues that were encountered along the way.

## Feature - Google Analytics
<br>

One of the project requirements was to connect the website to Google Analytics to get an analytical understanding of how users would interact with the website and what pages they gravitated to.
Adding this feature into this project also helped me understand how to add analytics to my personal website portfolio as well.
