<br><br>
For this course, the final group project consisted of agile web development [(project requirements)](https://github.com/kaw393939/webdev1_final_group)
<br>
In my group's Coffee Website, the design itself is very simple but also uses the same Github Pages template used for this website here. In the side nav, users can find a blog section, privacy policy, and incorporates Google Analytics and Mailchimp integrations to understand user metrics. 
I used the same coffee mug asset from my previous project, combining both project ideas (Fresh Brew Coffee Co. as a possible cafe to visit in the future?)

The course's github page is tied to the Professor, so it is private for now but feel free to inquire for more information on this project.

## Feature - [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/zs2EP6h9ywyqAfQfzFHB5P/Final-Project?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=jX160xV0E70pGjBu-1)

<br>
One of the project requirements was to make a mockup of the design of the website, to demonstrate what it ideally would look like.

Our team was able to work on this project using agile methodolgy by using Github's integrated Projects. We were able to assign each other User Stories to work on for this assignment, ranging from Technical Requirements, Design Requirements, and User Journey.
Having this integrated with other Github repository helped with linking specific pages where changes are made, or sharing screenshots of issues that were encountered along the way.

## Feature - Google Analytics
<br>

<br><br>
One of the project requirements was to connect the website to Google Analytics to get an analytical understanding of how users would interact with the website and what pages they gravitated to.
Adding this feature into this project also helped me understand how to add analytics to my personal website portfolio as well.

## Feature - MailChimp
<br>

All the users that are "subscribed" on from Mailchimp were added from subscribe feature on the website.
