## Hello! 
<br>
I'm a recent grad, receieved a Master of Science in Information Systems, specializing in Data Analytics at [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu) as of August 2023.
<br><br>
I also graduated from New Jersey Institute Technology with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology, specializing in Web Development back in 2020.

Just a little bit about me, I have a strong passion for music (I'm currenty teaching myself bass! & also play Animal Crossing and Rhythm games in my free time)
